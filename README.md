# Artist_Portfolio_Website

My very first website ever, created for a local artist using Bootstrap 4.

Simple layout with mostly Image Galleries and a video on the Homepage.
Main struggle back then for me was getting the breakpoints right...

Site is still being used (as a custom WordPress theme), see: http://danielbaden.de/
